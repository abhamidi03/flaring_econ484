# Mitigating the Impacts of Natural Gas Flaring
Code and Data for Natural Gas Flaring Analysis

Flaring, the controlled combustion of natural gas, is carried out to dispose of excess gas associated with oil production and preserve safe working conditions. It is associated with several negative environmental and health impacts due to the harmful emissions it releases. Solutions to mitigating these impacts include bringing more gas to market and implementing technological solutions to improve onsite intake of associated gas. This paper aims to determine the economic drivers of flaring. Utilizing a LASSO regression model, we identify gas reserves, gas consumption, and refinery capacity as significant contributors to changes in flaring. Due to the insignificance of price effects, we conclude that supply-focused onsite gas utilization technologies are likely to have a greater impact on flaring than market-focused solutions.
